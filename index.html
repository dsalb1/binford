      <h3 class="text-center">Here's a timeline of Dr. Binford's life:</h3>
      <ul>
         <li><b>1931 -</b> Born in Norfolk, Virginia</li>
         <li><b>1952 -</b> Joins the Military, where he is drafted as an interpretor and assigned to a group of anthropologists tasked with resettling people on the Pacific islands. He became involved with the recovery of archaeological materials from tombs on Okinawa that were to be removed to make way for a military base, his first taste of archaeology. 
   </li>
         <li><b>1957 -</b> Receives BA from the University of North Carolina</li>
         <li><b>1958 -</b> Receives MA from the University of Michigan. It is at Michigan that Binford first became disillusioned with traditional archaeologyâ€™s preoccupation with listing cultural traits and identifying archaeological phases, yet was excited by the work being done in anthropological theory by professors at Michigan such as Leslie White and Elman Service.</li>
         <li><b>1961 -</b> Joins Faculty at the University of Chicago</li>
         <li><b>1962 -</b>Publishes his first major work, <em>Archaeology is Anthropology</em>, where he first systematically lays out the New Archaeology paradigm. Binford advocated a rigorous positivist approach and argued that to be scientific, archaeologists must seek to formulate laws of cultural dynamics</li>
         <li><b>1964 -</b> Receives his Ph.D from the University of Michigan. His Ph.d dissertation focused on the interaction between Native Americans and the earliest English colonists in Virginia and was based on site surveys that he had started while at North Carolina. Ultimately it was an attempt to identify archaeological remains with known ethnic groups</li>
         <li><b>1968 -</b> Joins the faculty at the University of New Mexico</li>
         <li><b>1968 -</b> Publishes <em>New Perspectives in Archaeology</em>, a collection of papers derived from a symposium entitled "The Social Organization of Preshistoric Communities" at the 1965 American Anthropological Association meeting in Denver</li>  
         <li><b>1969 -</b> Undertakes ethnographic fieldwork among the Nunamuit in Alaska</li>
         <li><b>1978 -</b> Publishes <em>Nanamiut Ethnoarhaeology</em>, a landmark work in ethnoarchaeological research that focused on settlement and subsistence among the Nunamiut Eskimos of Alaska between 1969 and 1973</li>
         <li><b>1986 -</b> Awarded the Huxley Memorial Medal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (UK)</li>
         <li><b>2001 -</b>Publishes his magnum opus, <em>Constructing Frames of Reference</em>, in which he uses a database of ethnographic information and environmental data to examine the organization of hunter-gatherer societies to understand how they adapted to the environment</li>
         <li><b>2001 -</b> Elected to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences</li>
         <li><b>2003 -</b> Retires from academia</li>
         <li><b>2008 -</b> Awarded the Society of American Archaeologists Lifetime Achievement Award</li>
         <li><b>2011 -</b> Passes away in Kirksville, Missouri</li>
      </ul>
